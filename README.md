# SimpleMathNN
simple math neural network calculator
It can learn lenear operation such as : a+b , a-b,b-a,(a+b)*x....
it you use BACKPROBAGATION alrorithm 
X is your inputs , a list of matrixs that contain [a,b]
Y is your real output relevant to X inputs
xpredicted is your new input you wnat to know it's result
